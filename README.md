# Online players' behavior

This repository is part of a in progress master's project. Despite the importance of competitive video game in the world, such as the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games, there is still a lack of tools and researches based on behavior analysis to help players improve their skills. Threfore, the project aims to reduce this gap and focuses on finding patterns from the players' behavior to characterize them in relation to performance using machine learning, more specifically, clustering algorithms.

## Data

The game being analyzed is the League of Legends, a popular MOBA, and the data set (historical matches) we use is provided by Riot Games from its application public interface (API). A match history contains data such as game mode type and identification number. It also contains data from each participant in the match.

## Programming Languages

Two programming languages are used in the project: Python and R. Python to raw and parse the data and R to analyze it.

Run *pip install -r requeriments.txt* to install Python dependences.
